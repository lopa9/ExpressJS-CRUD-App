 # ExpressJs CRUD App

## 🔎Description
This Express CRUD app serves as a practical example of building a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. It provides users with the ability to create, read, update, and delete items in a straightforward manner. The application is designed to be lightweight and easy to understand, making it an excellent starting point for developers looking to learn about Express and RESTful principles.


### For a CRUD API, you typically need four types of operations:
👻Create (POST): Adds new data.

📖Read (GET): Retrieves data.

👽Update (PUT/PATCH): Modifies existing data.

💥Delete (DELETE): Removes data.

 ### 🔨Setting Up the Development Environment

 Once installed, open your terminal or command prompt and type:
